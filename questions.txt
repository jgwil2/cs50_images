0.  BMP supports up to 4,294,967,296 colors. GIF supports 256 colors. JPEG
    supports up to 16,777,216. PNG supports 16,777,216.
1.  GIF supports animation.
2.  Lossless compression allows all data to be recovered. Lossy compression
    does not.
3.  JPEG is lossy-compressed.
4.  The metadata/address associated with the file is erased and the blocks
    containing the data are listed as empty but the bytes remain unchanged.
5.  We can use a program to overwrite all of the bytes that were used to store
    data on the drive with a particular character or pattern.
6.  stdint.h is a header file that contains type definitions for integer types
    with fixed widths, i.e. stored on a fixed number of bits.
7.  These types are useful because other integer types can vary in size from
    system to system. To write a program that deals with a format like BMP, we
    need to be able to define integer types that always have the same number of
    bits no matter what system we are running on.
8.  A `BYTE` is an 8-bit (one byte) unsigned value. A `DWORD` is a 32-bit (four
    bytes) unsigned integer. A `LONG` is a 32-bit (four bytes) signed integer.
    A `WORD` is a 16-bit (two bytes) unsigned integer.
9.  The first two bytes of any BMP file are `BM` in ASCII or `424d` in hex.
10. `bfSize` represents the size of the file in bytes. `biSize` represents the
    size of the `BITMAPINFOHEADER` structure (40 bytes).
11. If `biHeight` is negative, the bitmap is ordered top-down, starting in the
    top-left corner.
12. The BMP's color depth is specified in `biBitCount`.
13. If the file is not successfully opened, NULL is returned.
14. We are reading files byte by byte, so each element read from the stream
    should always be 1 byte long.
15. If the width of the bitmap in pixels is 3, copy.c will assign `padding` the
    value of 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per RGBTRIPLE = 9, which is not a
    multiple of 4, so 3 more bytes of padding are added to get to 12.
16. The `fseek` function sets the file position indicator of a given stream to
    a new position relative to either the beginning or end of file or the
    current position of the indicator. An offset given in bytes is added to one
    of these values to obtain the new position.
17. `SEEK_CUR` is the current position indicator; it corresponds to the current
    position of a stream that is being read from.
18. Milo Banana dun it.
